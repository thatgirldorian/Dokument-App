# Dokument-App

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a web app I'm working on with my friend, Dara. I'm only responsible for the front-end.
We're building a platform where programmers can log issues they face while coding and the solutions that took them out of that rut.


<h3>Technology Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Github</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
 <h5> 1. Change the colour of the checkbox:</h5>
 I have been trying to change the colour of the checkbox and have not found a solution yet. Will update soon.
 <h5>Fix:</h5>
 I used the custom checkbox generator at https://bun.js.org/ and was able to get it done.
 
 <h5> 2. Adjust 'Signup button hover color':</h5>
 I could not get the signup button to display the color I wanted all through the button and the space containing the words "Create your account".
 <h5>Fix:</h5>
 I switched the <button> element for <input> and it worked great.

<h3>Solution:</h3>
